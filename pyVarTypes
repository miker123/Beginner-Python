#This shows the different Python variable types

#Numbers
#Number data types store numeric values.
var1 = 1
var2 = 10

#Strings
#Strings are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.
#Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes.

str = 'Hello World!'

print (str)          # Prints complete string
print (str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print (str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print (str + "TEST") # Prints concatenated string

#Lists
#A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).

list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print list          # Prints complete list
print list[0]       # Prints first element of the list
print list[1:3]     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print list[2:]      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinylist * 2  # Prints list two times
print list + tinylist # Prints concatenated lists


#Tuples
#Data Squence similar to lists, but tuples are enclosed within parentheses and and cannot be updated.
Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')

print tuple           # Prints complete list
print tuple[0]        # Prints first element of the list
print tuple[1:3]      # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print tuple[2:]       # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print tinytuple * 2   # Prints list two times
print tuple + tinytuple # Prints concatenated lists


#Dictionary
# dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs.
#A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. 
#Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

dict = {}
dict['one'] = "This is one"
dict[2]     = "This is two"

tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}

print dict['one']       # Prints value for 'one' key
print dict[2]           # Prints value for 2 key
print tinydict          # Prints complete dictionary
print tinydict.keys()   # Prints all the keys
print tinydict.values() # Prints all the values
